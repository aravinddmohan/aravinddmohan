A noobie frontend dev with a slightly unhealthy love for React, logic, and niche tech rabbit holes.  
Trying to balance being serious with being chronically online.

## 🚀 What I'm building (and breaking) right now

- Diving deep into almost anything: components, hooks, OOP, backend basics,  
  and wondering why tf everything breaks if I miss **one** character.  
- Crafting small, focused mini-projects to sharpen dev skills  
- Improving my Git discipline (wanna commit like those serious devs out there)  
- Leveling up my UI/UX intuition.

## 🌱 The TL;DR version of me

- Avid film buff 🎬  
- Loves exploring weird tech corners of the internet  
- trying to learn, debug and learn. (real, not GPT)
